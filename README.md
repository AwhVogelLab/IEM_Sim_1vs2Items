# IEM_Sim1vs2Item README

This simulation is part of the Sutterer, Foster et al. set size project.

This code runs the simulation reported in our paper (described in Materials and Methods, Encoding Models Simulations). You can run the simulation by running `runSimulation.m`. 

The .mat files in this folder are the results from our runs of the simulation code. The ones using a tuning width of 25 are the ones we report in the paper. Note that this synthetic data had a tuning width that matched that of our basis functions. We ran the simulation again using broader tuning (width of 13) and replicated the same pattern of results, which we mention very briefly in the manuscript.
